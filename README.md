# Hack-the-6ix
hack the 6ix submission

Helicapture was my submission to Hack the 6ix 2022. 

This Unity game allows the user to experience the thrill of operating a helicopter, with the goal of capturing little animal-like creatures on the ground. With immersive camera angles, clean UI elements, and a detailed environment, Helicapture was a project that showcased my growing ability to create aesthetically valuable projects.
